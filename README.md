# HatSphere Seller
This is the Android App for the Seller Interface.

The motivation for building of the online shopping portal was a very genuine one. The sales of the hand-made products in our country have dropped drastically over the last few decades with the advent of modernisation. Our group felt the need to restore the balance as the local craftsmen were finding it hard to make a living. So, we decided to build a pair of apps - buyer and seller - to promote the welfare of the local craftsmen.

## Features :
1.  The app is designed for the sellers to put up their products on display for purchase.

2.  It enables the users to create and manage their accounts.

3.  The seller will get notified whenever an order is placed. He/she will have the right to accept the order or reject it for time being.

4.  The final selling price will be calculated including the delivery charges depending on the address location of the customer.

## Contribution
I was assigned the task of developing the front-end of the application.
